## Installation and requirements ##

CABARET works hand in hand with the Mutation++ library https://github.com/mutationpp/Mutationpp. For CABARET to work, you need to make sure several things work with Mutation++. 

* First, download and install Mutation++ from the link above. 
* Subsequently, add this snippet of code to the file "Mutationpp/interface/python/src/pyMixture.cpp"
```
.def("mixtureSMass",
           static_cast<double (Mutation::Mixture::*)(void) const>(
               &Mutation::Mixture::mixtureSMass),
           "Returns the mixture averaged entropy in J/kg-K.")
```
* Type in the terminal in the build directory inside your Mutationpp folder
```
ccmake ..
```
and turn BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPER from OFF to ON.

* Compile Mutation++.

Once Mutation++ is installed, you need to get a local python module built in order to use it in Python. From your Mutationpp directory

* To compile the wrapper you need [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) in `thirdparty/pybind11`:

 ```
 git submodule add -b stable ../../pybind/pybind11 thirdparty/pybind11
 git submodule update --init
 ```

* and  [scikit-build](https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-package-with-pip) (use pip or pip3 depending on your local installation):

 ```
 pip install scikit-build
 ```

* We will use the file `setup.py` provided with Mutation++ in order to generate the package (use python or python3 depending on your local installation):

 ```
 python3 setup.py build
 ```

The procedure might take some minutes to complete. The built package is in `_skbuild/[your_distribution]/cmake-install/interface/python/mutationpp` (NOTE:  `your_distribution` varies with the OS you are using, e.g. `macosx-12.0-arm64-3.9`, `linux-x86_64-3.7` and the architecture used e.g. `macosx-12.0-x86_64-3.9`: be sure you check the name of the folder automatically generated in  `_skbuild/`); now you only need to

* Define a system variable in the right file for you (`.bashrc`, `.zprofile`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`).
```
export MPP_LOCALPY=$MPP_DIRECTORY/_skbuild/[your_distribution]/cmake-install/interface/python/mutationpp
```
* Close the terminal or `source` the right file (`.bashrc`, `.zprofile`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`).

Your local Mutation++ Python module is now readily accessible by CABARET.

To install CABARET just do in your terminal in the directory of your choice

```
git clone https://github.com/adelval1/pyCabaret.git
```

CABARET uses the following package versions

```
python 3.9.1
numpy 1.20.1
scipy 1.8.0
```

To run CABARET just specify the options you want in the input.in file and do in the /src folder

```
python cabaret.py
```

where python is your python installation.

For help on understanding the input file you can go to /docs/explanatory_input.in. To check out a comprehensive example you can go to /examples and run the jupyter notebook.

## Installation with pip ##


````shell
  cd pyropy
  pip install -e .
````

If you want to contribute to the project, plase activate the pre-commit hooks with:

````shell
  pre-commit install
````


## CABARET applications ##
The theoretical aspects of the modules included in CABARET can be found in the following conference paper:
